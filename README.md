# Problem/opportunity 
An economic crisis closely followed the public health crisis of COVID-19. In order to support communities as they reopen and recover, we want to develop a sense of the communities sustaining the hardest economic losses in order to confidently direct local investments where they might do the most good. 

Today, we have an anecdotal sense of which communities are hardest hit, but we want to find evidence to support or refute our hypotheses. We have access to economic data at a county level, but we want to develop more granular insights finding or deriving data for the zip code, or census tract, level to help measure the local economic impact of COVID-19.
